# R-1.4 Write a short Python function that takes a positive integer n and returns 
# the sum of the squares of all the positive integers smaller than n.
# R-1.5 Give a single command that computes the sum from Exercise R-1.4, relying 
# on Pythonâ€™s comprehension syntax and the built-in sum function.
